# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Regression Prediction Web App is a comprehensive machine learning application that enables users to make regression predictions through a web interface. The system consists of a trained regression model, a FastAPI backend service, and a responsive frontend interface that allows users to input features and receive predictions with optional model explanations.

## Glossary

- **Regression_Model**: A trained machine learning model capable of predicting continuous numerical values
- **FastAPI_Backend**: The REST API service built with FastAPI framework that serves predictions
- **Frontend_Interface**: The web-based user interface for inputting features and displaying predictions
- **Feature_Input**: Numerical or categorical data points used as input to the regression model
- **Prediction_Result**: The numerical output generated by the regression model
- **Model_Explanation**: Optional feature importance or model interpretation data
- **Health_Endpoint**: API endpoint that reports the operational status of the service
- **Validation_System**: Input validation mechanism that ensures feature data meets model requirements

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train and deploy a regression model, so that I can make predictions on new data through a web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized, THE Regression_Model SHALL be trained on a regression dataset using Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Network algorithms
2. WHEN model training completes, THE Regression_Model SHALL be serialized and saved to persistent storage for deployment
3. WHEN the model is evaluated, THE Regression_Model SHALL achieve measurable performance metrics including RMSE, MAE, and R² scores
4. WHEN the saved model is loaded, THE Regression_Model SHALL maintain identical prediction capabilities as the original trained model
5. WHEN model training data is processed, THE Regression_Model SHALL handle the complete feature set required for the chosen regression task

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to send feature data and receive predictions, so that I can integrate regression capabilities into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is sent to /predict/regression with valid feature inputs, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL return a numerical prediction result
2. WHEN feature inputs are received, THE Validation_System SHALL verify all required features are present and within acceptable ranges
3. WHEN invalid input data is submitted, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL return appropriate error messages with HTTP status codes
4. WHEN the prediction endpoint is called, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL process requests within reasonable response time limits
5. WHEN multiple prediction requests are made, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL handle concurrent requests without data corruption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and documentation of the API service, so that I can ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is sent to /health, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL return the current operational status of the service
2. WHEN the health endpoint is accessed, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL verify model availability and system resources
3. WHEN a GET request is sent to /docs, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL serve comprehensive API documentation
4. WHEN documentation is accessed, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL display all available endpoints with request/response schemas
5. WHEN API errors occur, THE FastAPI_Backend SHALL log error details for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to input feature values through a web form and see prediction results, so that I can easily use the regression model without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display an input form with fields for all required model features
2. WHEN feature values are entered, THE Validation_System SHALL provide real-time feedback on input validity
3. WHEN the prediction form is submitted, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL send data to the backend and display the prediction result clearly
4. WHEN predictions are generated, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL optionally display feature importance or model explanation data
5. WHEN the interface is accessed on different devices, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL maintain responsive design and usability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand, deploy, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is accessed, THE documentation SHALL include complete setup instructions for all components
2. WHEN API integration is needed, THE documentation SHALL provide example requests using curl and Postman formats
3. WHEN model performance is evaluated, THE documentation SHALL include RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics with interpretation
4. WHEN the codebase is explored, THE project SHALL be organized into models/, api/, and frontend/ directories
5. WHEN deployment is attempted, THE documentation SHALL specify all dependencies and configuration requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the application to be thoroughly tested, so that I can ensure reliability and correctness before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built, THE testing suite SHALL validate all API endpoints with various input scenarios
2. WHEN model predictions are generated, THE testing suite SHALL verify prediction accuracy against known test cases
3. WHEN invalid inputs are processed, THE testing suite SHALL confirm appropriate error handling and responses
4. WHEN the frontend is tested, THE testing suite SHALL validate form submission and result display functionality
5. WHEN integration testing is performed, THE testing suite SHALL verify end-to-end functionality from frontend to model prediction
